# ADR 6: Applying Guardrails to usage of GenAI

## Status

**Accepted**

## Context

- I want to utilize SonarLint and ESLinting to build Guardrails and Constraints on my code, including cyclomatic complexity, cognitive complexity, and enforcement of design patterns and best practices.
- I don't know how to enforce these things (especially the latter two), but I have an idea that SonarLint and ESLint can enforce complexity.
- I want to establish a code review process that involves me (the sole developer) and as much automation/configuration as possible to make adherence to best practices and design patterns, possible using GitHub Actions as well if necessary.
